# Stream: qa-speed (quality pass 2: is it fast and steady)

Status: in progress

Goal: the game loads quickly, runs smoothly and stays steady over a long
session, as published.

## Milestones

- [ ] Load time. Measure title-screen time and first town and first map time
  from the published bundle (`tools/bundle-artifact.mjs`, served with the
  packs as `tools/verify-single.mjs` or similar does). Find the biggest waits
  (pack downloads, texture decode, mesh building, shader compile) and cut
  them: show progress, load in the background, build lazily, warm shaders
  behind the loading card.
- [ ] Hitches. First sight of a monster or boss stalls 0.15 to 2.9 s while its
  body is built. Move that work off the frame (worker, prebuild during map
  load for the map's monster list, or spread over frames). Same for any other
  stall over 50 ms you find.
- [ ] Garbage. Per-step garbage at depth 1 is 290 to 440 KB against 200
  (number boxing in creature IK and AI maths; `check-perf --alloc` names it).
  Bring it under the line without changing behaviour.
- [ ] Long session. The full default soak (3 runs x 3 maps x 300 frames) never
  ran because it takes 90 minutes. Split it into runs under 45 minutes each
  and run them all. Memory, GPU objects and frame time stay flat. Fix leaks.
- [ ] Sound mix. Loudness balance between music, ambience, skills, hits and
  UI. No sound that clips or drowns everything. Check headlessly by
  measuring peak and RMS of what plays in common scenes.
- [ ] Handover with before and after numbers.

## Results

(fill in)

## Next up

1. Run Setup in `docs/remake/PROTOCOL.md`.
2. Read `docs/remake/finish.md` (Handover), `src/core/Assets.ts` (packs) and
   `tools/check-perf.mjs`.
3. Start with load time.

## Notes for resume

- The published build packs assets: `assets/packs.json` plus seven `.wasm`
  packs. The dev server has no packs and fetches loose files.
- Do not change stats, balance or monster counts.
